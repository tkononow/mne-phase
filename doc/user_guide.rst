But this should be longer than the `Quick start <quick_start.html>`_


1. Download and setup mne-phase
-------------------------------

To use this package need to clone the ``mne-phase`` repository and install it
in its development form::

    $ git clone https://github.com/brainthemind/mne-phase.git
    $ cd mne-phase
    $ pip install -e .

Then open a ipython terminal and just do::

    >>> from mne_phase.utils import *

And at this point you have all the wanders ``mne_phase`` has to offer.
